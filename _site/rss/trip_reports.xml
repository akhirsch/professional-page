<p>I’m yet again waiting for a plane, though now it is the plane that will take me from Götenborg to London, and from London back to the US. I am sitting at the gate, watching the plane be refueled and inspected. However, I have power for my laptop, so I am relatively happy.</p>
<p>It has been an eventful, if short, trip. Sunday, I landed in Götenborg, then I took a taxi to my hotel. The taxi driver charged me 420kr, which I’m pretty sure was a ripoff (the taxi ride from the hotel to the airport was 385kr, so that helped in that assumption), but at that point I was too tired to much care. I was able to check in to the hotel, then I emailed Arnar, who is a PhD student at Chalmers. When I did not receive an email from him, I decided that it would be in my best interest to find my way to Chalmers. I looked up where it was on google maps, and set out. This turned out to be a bad idea, and before too long I was back at the hotel asking for directions. It turns out it was just up the road, or a tram ride away. I walked to the tram station, but I couldn’t see the lines I was told to wait for (7 or 10). So, I walked up the road, and found what appeared to be the university, next to a tram stop, just as I had been told.</p>
<p>It turns out that while I had indeed found the university, the <em>entrance</em> to the university was another tram stop away. However, not knowing this at the time, I trekked through campus and found the building I was looking for, after much ado. However, the building, and almost all of the others, were locked. After an uncomfortably long time in the snow, I finally found that the student union was unlocked, and I was able to go in and buy my self a cup of coffee for 15kr, which is about equivalent to $1, a good price, compared to the places I could get coffee in DC. I then found my way out of the university, (finding the Chalmers tram stop while I was at it, so I knew where to go the next day), and down the road to my hotel. When I got there, I found that I had received a message from Arnar asking if I wanted to meet almost an hour ago! Turns out he emailed me right as I set out from my hotel, and since I have no international plan, I cannot receive mail here in Sweden without wi-fi.</p>
<p>Luckily, he was kind enough to meet up with me, along with Pablo, another PhD student here. Arnar and Pablo showed me the mall area in town, and Arnar took me for a traditional christmas drink of hot spiced wine, which was quite good. We got to chat for a bit, and he was very kind indeed. I looked forward to being at Chalmers the next day. I went and got dinner for myself, just some fast food, where the differences from American fast food were as staggering as they were small. I then went to my hotel and immediately fell asleep, not having slept for over 24 hours at that point.</p>
<p>The next day I had an appointment with Andrei at 9:30, and I walked to Chalmers and got to his building by 9:20. However, I immediately got lost in his building, and ended up getting to his office a bit late, at 9:40. It turns out, the building has two of every floor, due to a disagreement between the computer scientists and computer engineers when the building was built! Luckily, Andrei was very forgiving. I spent the entire day meeting various people in his department, mostly from the computer security crowd. It was a very good crowd, full of people who were obviously very tight-knit. I went back to my hotel, then, with a promise of a full day the next day, with some more one-on-one meetings, along with my talk and my interview.</p>
<p>The next day I was dead-set on figuring out the tram: it couldn’t be that difficult! And indeed, it wasn’t. It turns out that the station that my hotel is next to, Vasaplatsen, has two stops around from the corner to each other: the one I wanted was not the one I was looking at. Finding this, I was able easily to take the tram to Chalmers, where I gave my talk. After the talk, I had about an hour before lunch, which I spent working on my research. Of course, it was before 6am in the US, which made any collaboration impossible. However, lunch was interesting, and I was told that both my Texan accent (in the word “get,” which I of course pronounced “git”), and my choice of research advisor showed. I was also told that the talk was “ecclectic”: apparently, it’s strange to have a talk where one minute one is philosophising on what belief means, and the next, talking about bug reports made to a system.</p>
<p>The interview also went well: it did not take long afterwords to be told that I had been accepted to the program, and I was told that most of the conversation in the meantime was on how strong my candidacy was. That evening, I was taken out by a group of the PhD students that I had met in the group to celebrate.</p>
<p>The next day consisted of a lunch with two of the type theory group from Chalmers, along with Andrei and Willard, a PhD student in the security group who I had spent some time with the day before. Afterwords, I “took fika” (a wonderful Swedish tradition of a coffee break with coworkers or friends, I rather like the idea: apparently, at Chalmers, all of the PhD students in the department take fika together once a week; a tradition I think could be extended to the US) with a group of PhD students that I had previously not gotten a chance to meet. This made me somewhat late for my second one-on-one meeting with Andrei, but he was again very forgiving. We talked a bit on a paper that we had both read the day before for this purpose: an overview of location-based security. It turns out that there is very little principled work in the area; this is something Andrei would like to change. I am intrigued: even more than other areas, it allows me to work on my small program of applying semantic analysis to fields that are not directly linguistic, as the area is of course interested in geometric and temporal data.</p>
<p>That evening, I was invited to attend the department’s Christmas party. It started again with the warm red wine, this time it included raisens and almonds (in an interesting sidenote, this was the first time I encountered a Swede who did not speak English fluently — the lady serving the wine had to ask Willard, who was explaining things to me, what the name of the nut was in English). I also at this time encountered the fesitval of Santa Lucia for the first time; it is an alien experience to see a woman with candles on her head singing christmas carols.</p>
<p>At the dinner, I was able to sit with a group of people who were in the functional programming group at Chalmers. It was an interesting group, and I got to learn a lot. The group I was sitting with consisted of a Swede, an Englishman, and a Russian. I learned quite a bit about the differences between American and British English from that talk, mostly from us trying to explain the differences to our non-native speaking compatriats.</p>
<p>I have, since I first started writing, flown yet again to Britain, and I am now waiting for my plane to the States. I had to wait in line for over an hour to get to passport control, and then another half an hour to get to security. However, I did get upgraded to business class, apparently the economy class was quite full. Now, however, my plane doesn’t board until 16:45, and so I do not find out until 16:00 or so what gate I’m even at. It is currently nearly that time, I hope that my flight will be announced soon. In the meantime, I expect a relatively uneventful trip to the US: I will post this when I am there and I have connectivity again.</p>
<p>It has now been much time since I wrote this; an uneventful trip it was not. Instead, I ended up going to the first-class lounge (thanks to a random upgrade), and then I waited for the time for my plane to be announced. It took many hours, and my plane ended up not leaving until 19:00. Then, when we were allowed on, rather than walking down the walkway and onto the plane, we were instead bused to another terminal, then lead up a metal staircase onto the plane. We got on, and got comfortable (very comfortable, up here); then we find out the truck attached to the plane is broken. It takes more time to get moving. However, we are now well into the air, and dinner has been taken away.</p>
<p>I was planning on working at this part of the trip. However, I yet again have no connectivity, and I have proven to myself that my new semantics is still unsound. I have therefore taken to writing, and watching the Shakespeare show that they have on the tv here.</p>

<p>I’m currently sitting in the Dulles International Airport here Washington, DC, waiting on my British Airways flight to take me to Götenborg, Sweden, to interview at Chalmers Tekniska Högskola, the Technical University there. I am being considered for a position as a PhD student in language-based security there by Professor Andrei Sabelfeld, an old friend of my research professor, Professor Michael Clarkson.</p>
<p>Currently, the plan is for my plane to land at 10:30 AM local time on Sunday, and then, after getting through customs, I will head to my hotel to check in, and then the rest of Sunday is mine. I will probably meet up with Andrei’s current PhD student, Arnar Birgisson, and have him show me the city. Monday morning, I start my meetings at 9:30 local time with Andrei, who I will be meeting face-to-face for the first time there. That day, I will spend all day meeting with professors, PhD students, and postdocs there at Chalmers.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning, I will be giving my talk on the Nexus Authorization Logic; I gave this same talk to the New Jersey Programming Languages and Systems seminar at the University of Pennsylvania last month, so I know the talk pretty well. However, there is definitely still room for improvement, especially in the patter; I will be working on this during the flight to London. Apparently at my talk at NJPLS, the “high-level ideas and enthusiasum” showed through, but not the details. I will be focusing on trying to remedy this.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon, I have my official interview with Andrei.</p>
<p>Wednesday has yet to be scheduled, but that evening is the Christmas party for the computer science department; I will be joining them there. I have been led to believe that this is a bigger affair then the one at GW, I will wait and see.</p>
<p>Thursday, I fly back to the United States, landing back at Dulles at 8:00.</p>
<p>Today, though, my focus is on getting to London (where I have a layover). Security was less bad than it usually is when I fly domestic, probably because this is too early for holiday travelers, and nowhere near summer vacation time. However, the security theater got in my way, as it usually does: today, I had my bag re-scanned because I had the absolute gall to bring toothpaste with me.</p>
<p>I will be writing more during and after the trip.</p>
