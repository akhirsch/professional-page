            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>This is the professional website and blog of Andrew K. Hirsch. I am a PhD student at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I graduated from The George Washington University in 2013, with degrees in both Computer Science and Pure Mathematics.</p>
<p>My interest are mostly in programming languages and logic. I am especially interested in functional and object-oriented languages, and their interpretations under the propositions-as-types paradigm. However, I am also interested in the use of logic in computer science, and the foundations of computer science, mathematics, and science.</p>
<p>Please check out my current and former research, and look at my blog posts to see my take on issues of current interest to me. You can also find me on <a href="https://http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Hirsch_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">the arXiv</a> if youâ€™re interested in reading some of my technical reports.</p>
