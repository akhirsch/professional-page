<p>I’m currently sitting in the Dulles International Airport here Washington, DC, waiting on my British Airways flight to take me to Götenborg, Sweden, to interview at Chalmers Tekniska Högskola, the Technical University there. I am being considered for a position as a PhD student in language-based security there by Professor Andrei Sabelfeld, an old friend of my research professor, Professor Michael Clarkson.</p>
<p>Currently, the plan is for my plane to land at 10:30 AM local time on Sunday, and then, after getting through customs, I will head to my hotel to check in, and then the rest of Sunday is mine. I will probably meet up with Andrei’s current PhD student, Arnar Birgisson, and have him show me the city. Monday morning, I start my meetings at 9:30 local time with Andrei, who I will be meeting face-to-face for the first time there. That day, I will spend all day meeting with professors, PhD students, and postdocs there at Chalmers.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning, I will be giving my talk on the Nexus Authorization Logic; I gave this same talk to the New Jersey Programming Languages and Systems seminar at the University of Pennsylvania last month, so I know the talk pretty well. However, there is definitely still room for improvement, especially in the patter; I will be working on this during the flight to London. Apparently at my talk at NJPLS, the “high-level ideas and enthusiasum” showed through, but not the details. I will be focusing on trying to remedy this.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon, I have my official interview with Andrei.</p>
<p>Wednesday has yet to be scheduled, but that evening is the Christmas party for the computer science department; I will be joining them there. I have been led to believe that this is a bigger affair then the one at GW, I will wait and see.</p>
<p>Thursday, I fly back to the United States, landing back at Dulles at 8:00.</p>
<p>Today, though, my focus is on getting to London (where I have a layover). Security was less bad than it usually is when I fly domestic, probably because this is too early for holiday travelers, and nowhere near summer vacation time. However, the security theater got in my way, as it usually does: today, I had my bag re-scanned because I had the absolute gall to bring toothpaste with me.</p>
<p>I will be writing more during and after the trip.</p>
