## Theses and Research Projects

- Categorical Semantics for Type-And-Effect Systems

Effects are ubiquitous in programming languages.
Ever since Moggi introduced monads in his computational lambda calculus, there have been generalizations and reformulations of categorical semantics of effect systems.
My work involves pushing back on the assumptions that are made in these models, and in applying those models to understand issues in programming languages.
My most recent work involves relaxing the assumptions about the structure of the language that these models are built on.

- Semantics for Authorization Logics

Authorization logics are used to describe and prove properties of authorization policies.
We give a new semantics for authorization logics, based on the informal notion of semantics for
the Nexus Authorization Logic (NAL).
We show that this semantics is equivalent to the more traditional Kripke semantics.
This work was published in Computer and Communications Security 2013 in Berlin, Germany.

- Domain Specific Language for Composite

Composite is a component-based operating system developed at The George Washington University.
I developed a domain specific language for specifing communication between components.
The language automatically inserted dynamic checks to ensure that communication happened correctly.
This served as my Capstone Design project for my Bachelor's of Science degree.

- Turing Categories for Computability Theorists

Turing categories are a definition of computability in category theory.
I discuss Turing categories, and note their use in proving theories in computability theory.
This served as an Honor's thesis for my Bachelor's of Science degree.
