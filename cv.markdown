## Theses and Research Projects

- Categorical Semantics for Type-And-Effect Systems

Effects are ubiquitous in programming languages.
Ever since Moggi introduced monads in his computational lambda calculus,
there have been generalizations and reformulations of categorical semantics of effect systems.
Ross Tate discovered productors, the most general semantics for a large class of effects.
I have been working on expanding the theory of productors (and consumptors, their dual).

- Intuitionistic Model Theory

Intuitionistic logics are an area of current active research interest.
However, all of the completeness results to date have used classical meta-logics.
Indeed, there are theorems that show that no instuitionistic completeness theorem exists.
However, by using uniform evidence, it is possible to gain a intuitionistic completeness theorem for intuitionistic logic.
This was shown by Constable and Bickford.
I have been working on expanding this, and in particular on exploring connections with classical model theory.

- Semantics for Authorization Logics

Authorization logics are used to describe and prove properties of authorization policies.
We give a new semantics for authorization logics, based on the informal notion of semantics for
the Nexus Authorization Logic (NAL).
We show that this semantics is equivalent to the more traditional Kripke semantics.
This work is in Computer and Communications Security 2013 in Berlin, Germany.

- Domain Specific Language for Composite

Composite is a component-based operating system developed at The George Washington University.
I developed a domain specific language for specifing communication between components.
The language automatically inserted dynamic checks to ensure that communication happened correctly.
This served as my Capstone Design project for my Bachelor's of Science degree.

- Turing Categories for Computability Theorists

Turing categories are a definition of computability in category theory.
I discuss Turing categories, and note their use in proving theories in computability theory.
This served as an Honor's thesis for my Bachelor's of Science degree.
