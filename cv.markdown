## Research Projects

- Flow-Limited Authorization Logics

Authorization logics are often used to describe correctness for authorizaiton mechanisms in distributed systems. 
They allow flexibility in defining authorization policies and proof-theoretic tools for providing security guarantees. 
However, these logics generally do not reflect the fact that often authorization decisions are based on private or low-integrity data. 
We (Hirsch, Cecchetti, Arden, and Tate) are developing FLAFOL, the Flow-Limited Authorization First-Order Logic, which is an authorization logic with information flow labels. 
FLAFOL describes the correctness of authorization mechanisms which respect information flow policies. FLAFOL also provides unique security guarantees: not only do the standard notions of non-interference for authorization logic and information flow labels hold, but we can show that the action of a correct authorization mechanism (with reference to FLAFOL) cannot leak private information, as determined by the labels.

- Categorical Semantics for Type-And-Effect Systems

Effects are ubiquitous in programming languages.
Ever since Moggi introduced monads in his computational lambda calculus, there have been generalizations and reformulations of categorical semantics of effect systems.
My work involves pushing back on the assumptions that are made in these models, and in applying those models to understand issues in programming languages.
My most recent work involves relaxing the assumptions about the structure of the language that these models are built on.
