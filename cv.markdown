## Education
- Masters in Computer Science, Cornell University (Expected), 2015
- BS in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics, The George Washington University, 2013

## Research Interests
- Programming Languages
- Mathematical Logic
- Type Theory

## Theses and Research Projects

- Semantics for Authorization Logics

Authorization logics are used to describe and prove properties of authorization policies.
We give a new semantics for authorization logics, based on the informal notion of semantics for
the Nexus Authorization Logic (NAL).
We show that this semantics is equivalent to the more traditional Kripke semantics.
This work is currently in submission.

- Domain Specific Language for Composite

Composite is a component-based operating system developed at The George Washington University.
I developed a domain specific language for specifing communication between components.
The language automatically inserted dynamic checks to ensure that communication happened correctly.
This served as my Capstone Design project for my Bachelor's of Science degree.

- Turing Categories for Computability Theorists

Turing categories are a definition of computability in category theory.
I discuss Turing categories, and note their use in proving theories in computability theory.
This served as an Honor's thesis for my Bachelor's of Science degree.
