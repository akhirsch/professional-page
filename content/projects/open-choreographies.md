# Abstract
Programming concurrent and distributed systems is notoriously difficult and error prone. 
Since most concurrent and distributed programs are designed as a set of communicating components, incorrect communication protocols can to difficult-to-debug errors.
Choreographic programming is a recent programming paradigm for message-passing communication which helps developers codesign computations,
thereby eliminating the possibility of errors within communication protocols.
Unfortunately, choreographic programs require that all components are codesigned, preventing the usage and composability with off-the-shelf software.
In this proposal we will develop open choreographies: choreographies that allow codesigned components to communicate with the outside world.
