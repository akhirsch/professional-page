# Abstract

We have been working on a compiler for a functional choreographic programming language based on [the origional Pirouette paper](@/papers/pirouette/index.md).
This has served as both a research project and as a learning platform for undergraduates via the [UB CSE Experiential Learning and Research (EL/R) program](https://webdev.cse.buffalo.edu/elr/).

# Source Code

The source code for the compiler can be found on [github](https://github.com/Foundations-of-Decentralization-Group/Pirouette-Compiler).
