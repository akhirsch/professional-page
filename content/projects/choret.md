# Abstract

Choret is an experimental implementation of choreographic programming as a library inside of [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
By using Racket macros, we are able to provide a traditional project-and-merge implementation of choreographies as an embedded DSL.

# Source Code

The source code for Choret can be found on [github](https://github.com/Foundations-of-Decentralization-Group/choret).
