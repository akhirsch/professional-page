abstract="Concurrent programming often entails meticulous pairing of sends and receives between participants to avoid deadlock. Choreographic programming alleviates this burden by specifying the system as a single program. However, there are more applications than implementations of choreographies, and developing new implementations takes a lot of time and effort. Our work uses Racket to expedite building a new choreographic language called Choret. Racket has a powerful macro system which allows Choret to reuse much of its infrastructure for greater functionality and correctness."
