<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>My research focuses on the uses of semantics in computer science,
especially the denotational semantics of programming languages, systems, and logics.
My advisor is <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ross">Ross Tate</a>; we are interested in the semantics of effects.</p>
