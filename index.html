<p>Hello!</p>

<p>This is the website and blog of Andrew K. Hirsch.
The blog posts here are my little contributions to the computer science culture of the internet.
I post about projects that I'm working on, ideas that I'm playing with, and cool things I've found.</p>

<p>I also post reports on my professional trips, an idea I got from Edsgar Dijkstra.
You can also find my reports on my research projects.
The recent posts, and reports are listed below.</p>
