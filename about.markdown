This is the professional website of Andrew K. Hirsch. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. I recieved my PhD from Cornell University in 2019, and my Bachelor's degree from The George Washington University in 2013 with majors in both Computer Science and Pure Mathematics.

My interest are mostly in programming languages and logic. I am especially interested in applying semantic reasoning to the foundations of computer security. However, I am also interested in the foundations of computer science, mathematics, and science, especially those using type theory.

Please check out my current and former research and publications.
You can also find me on

if you're interested in reading some of my technical reports.
