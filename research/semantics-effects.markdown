title: Semantics of Type-And-Effect Systems
---

Effects are ubiquitous in programming languages.
Ever since Moggi introduced monads in his computational lambda calculus,
there have been generalizations and reformulations of categorical semantics of effect systems.
Ross Tate discovered productors, the most general semantics for a large class of effects.
I have been working on expanding the theory of productors (and consumptors, their dual).
