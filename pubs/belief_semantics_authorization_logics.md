Abstract: Authorization logics have been used in the theory of computer security to reason about access control decisions.
In this work, a formal belief semantics for authorization logics is given.
The belief semantics is proved to subsume a standard Kripke semantics.
The belief semantics yields a direct representation of principalsâ€™ beliefs, without resorting to the technical machinery used in Kripke semantics.
A proof system is given for the logic; that system is proved sound with respect to the belief and Kripke semantics.
The soundness proof for the belief semantics, and for a variant of the Kripke semantics, is mechanized in Coq.
